If you can eat a jalapeno without wincing, you should be fine.

The taste is reasonably chocolatey, I'm really not too hungry afterwards, and the nutrition is very good. Tried it mixed with ice in a &#34;shake&#34; and that even improves it a bit.I like the fact that you get six grams of protein in the shake. That's a good healthy start and a decent energy boost.A lot of the other shakes I have tried do not have fiber and thus the fiber has to be added. In this case, you have 6 grams of fiber, which is just enough to balance out the 8 grams of sugar.  The sugar also comes from cane syrup, which is better in my opinion than high fructose corn syrup.It's not a significant contributor to any of your major nutrients, so it's probably a good idea to take a multivitamin if you are relying on the drink for more than one meal.Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this brand.

The first ingredient in this spread is sugar. Yes, real sugar not high fructose corn syrup, but 21 grams of sugar in a 2 tbsp serving is a powerful punch of sugar. My favorite peanut butter (Jif Extra Crunchy) has 3 grams of sugar for a comparable serving with a lot more fiber to balance out the sugar rush. Cocoa and almonds are down on the list of ingredients past the fats. Both my husband and I agreed that the chocolate taste is stronger than the almonds. Try a Hershey's chocolate almond bar before you commit to a jar of this and if you like that flavor, you should be good with the spread.If you're looking for a sweet frosting consistency spread with a Hershey bar with almond flavor, run and grab a jar of this stuff. You are going to love it.  It is kid sweet and it'll be great on sandwiches, with carrots or celery, or even as a frosting for brownies or cupcakes. You may like it with fruit, but not if you're looking for something that will bring out the natural flavor of the fruit--this is way too sweet for anything except maybe bananas--it will definitely overpower strawberries or milder fruits.Rebecca Kyle, March 2014\", reviewTime='03 3, 2014', reviewerID='A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5', reviewerName='R.

Once upon a time I was that crazy chick that would walk into the movies, buy the popcorn and then leave.  I had a roommate that for every special occasion gifted me with movie popcorn.  This means on those days she was the crazy chick going to the movies for takeout popcorn.I have never ever been able to duplicate that taste.  Nothing comes close, and this really doesn&#8217;t either.  It has a distinct butter flavor, but it&#8217;s just not the same.  Do I have to get a job at the local theater to finally figure out what that delicious bunch of chemicals is?When using their popcorn seasonings, this really helps with the sprinkles flavor and helping it to adhere to the popcorn.  It complements the flavors, whereas, to me, plain butter competes with the flavor of whatever powdery sprinkle you choose.It has a lighter taste than the movie theater original, and for some that may be a plus.  It definitely doesn&#8217;t taste like the real deal but it&#8217;s good in its own way!Cherise Everhard, June 2014', reviewTime='06 4, 2014', reviewerID='A37E6RW5BUX4U0', reviewerName='Cherise Everhard', summary='mmmmmmm popcorn', unixReviewTime=1401840000),\n",

Not opening a 1lb bag and wolfing it down in one sitting!Plus #4 is affordability.  It's a lot cheaper than buying the Smart Food and a little goes a long way.The only downer I can find in this product is the fact that it won't adhere to the popcorn without butter or oil.

So I got an air popper and I still put butter and salt on it, but I use less and without the oil it gives me the illusion of being healthier.So when I was offered the butter sprinkles, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try.  Well it didn&#8217;t work, at all.  If you are air popping these sprinkles do not stay on without first using butter or the Kernel Seasons Oil.  I tried.  I sprinkled during popping, immediately after popping, and all I ended up with was flavorless popcorn and the bottom of the bowl filled with butter sprinkles.Why would I need butter flavor if I am going to use butter or oil to get it to adhere to the corn?

Butternut squash is great with banana. The carrot is good with berries and the spinach will work in cocoa. But, the recipes on the box got me thinking. I'm not particularly enthused about the idea of adding the purees to food mixes, example:  add the butternut squash to a package of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.I'd rather make my own. I already know that the carrot is great for a stock replacer in vegetable soup. You can use either dehydrated or frozen veggie soup stock and add the carrot to make a really nice vegetable soup without the &#34;caramel&#34; coloring that's now found to be carcinogenic.I am planning on making squash casserole and using the butternut squash instead of some of the milk and butter.  Might even use it in a kind of &#34;Alfredo&#34; sauce for some black pepper pasta I have in the cabinets.I confess, the spinach is not inspiring me. I really like spinach, but the green puree is pretty unappealing. I'm thinking it might work great in a spinach souffle. Might even try it instead of milk in scrambled eggs for Green Eggs and Ham.Really, the possibilities are pretty endless.  It's a great way to add more veg to your diet and it saves you the time of cooking and creaming the vegetables to do it.R.

Now we have our fancy coffee daily and don&#8217;t have to fight with the salesman and customer to get a cuppa!I keep a drawer of snacks for those times when my hunger overtakes me and I need a quick fix, trail mix, raisins and instant oatmeal packets are always on hand.  When I was offered this product I was excited as it takes the normal oatmeal packets to a whole other level.I first poured the oatmeal and the fruit and nut packet in a mug and soon realized it was going to be way too small for my meal.  I didn&#8217;t like how crammed it was going to be &#8211; so I transferred those contents to a bowl &#8211; then set the mug under the Keurig as directed.  Placed the little apple spice container in the machine and presto &#8211; a fragrant hot water came out.  It smelled like Hot Cider or Wassail - Yum.  We aren&#8217;t quite sure what ounces our Keurig is so I had used the smallest setting.  In mixing the oatmeal I felt, at first, it was going to be too watery.  So I ended up dumping a bit of the remaining water down the sink.  I was bummed that after it sat a while it thickened and I realized that water would have been perfect as it was a tad too dry for my tastes.  But the flavor was delicious and the oatmeal wasn&#8217;t as mushy as instant oatmeal usually is.The next time I made it I used the full cup of water and was happy with the results.  The texture and moisture was perfect.  The addition of the fruit and nut packet make it more of a meal than a snack, but sometimes that is just what I need.  The box it all comes in is a bit bulky and space sucking, so I immediately ditched the box and used my own storage for its contents.  It&#8217;s hearty, sweet and delicious, easy and quick to make.

       " Row(asin='B00ISVHJ3Y', helpful=[4, 4], overall=4.0, reviewText=\"Stevia is my preferred sweetener now. A little goes a long way if you are sweetening a drink--it's about 30 times sweeter than regular sugar.The only problem with Stevia is that it doesn't brown and you have to adjust the ingredients of your recipe to account for less dry ingredients, so you can't use it as well for baking. This product is half organic sugar and half Stevia, which will allow you to bake with it better since it browns. There's a chart on the side of the bag which will tell you how much of this blend to use as a substitute for sugar in cooking. You may have to alter the amount of dry ingredients to compensate for less bulk in this product than regular sugar when you do bake.NOTE:  it does have 5 calories per teaspoonful, so you're going to have to be aware of the &#34;cost&#34; of using the product. The good news for me is that I really only need a teaspoon to sweeten my tea, so that's not too bad. Organic or not, sugar is still sugar. It's been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and a whole list of medical complications, so use it with moderation.One warning:  Stevia may not be suitable for those with allergies to ragweed. Use with caution if you have allergies, particularly when you're in the season.R. Kyle, May 2014\", reviewTime='05 29, 2014', reviewerID='A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5', reviewerName='R.
